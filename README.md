# Code Refactor Starter Code

There were a few targeted goals towards this code refactor.

- HTML and CSS were both modified to make it more web accessibile for viewers with disabilities by adding alt elements.
- CSS code was condensed for a cleaner appearance.
- Div's were transformed into more specific elements to make the code more organized and easier to read.
- Links in the navigation bar were fixed and are now functioning.
- Comments were added to both HTML and CSS to help the reader understand the structure and layout of the code better.
